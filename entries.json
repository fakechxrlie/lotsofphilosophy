Usually written when im high and I will go over and talk about topic of all sorts. If your reading this then hi |˶˙ᵕ˙ )ﾉﾞ"

      "entry": "Here I go, my experience with Magic Mushrooms and Psilocybin. It was a pretty positive experience overall, it felt out of this world in some sort of a way. I was thinking things I couldn't comprehend normally but I was comprehending just fine while on them. It was almost as like I solved the key to life, it's hard to put it into words but this was just my experience. I am having a hard time recalling everything TBH, and I wonder if there is some sort of way we as humans can extract and use this information. Everything suddenly made sense to me even if it didn't before hand. On one hand I feel more at peace with my life while on the other hand I strive to understand exactly what happened. Next time I take them I want to set the intention for myself, this was my first time ever taking them and I wanted to take them to know what it was like to experience it. Now that I have an understanding of what exactaly it can do I strive to find out more I feel as if it will drive me into insanity if I don't."

      "entry": "Everybody has different views as to what happens. Personally, since I am an athiest, I don't believe in any sort of afterlife, when we die our brains and organs stop, everything you've ever heard, saw, experienced, was all formulated in your brain. This includes all knowledge about religion, when your brain stops, you will not see, hear, feel, experience, anything. Just the thought of death is creepy in itself. If you get killed, Everything will be gone and you will cease to exist. It's impossible to comprehend what happens after you die, because its nothing. People can just have their lives stripped away and they won't know it or care. People get killed daily, just like that boom. It's like they were never here, so what do we do, we fill up land with dead bodies in overpriced wood boxes. In my personal opinion unless you can harvest organs to donate keeping the dead body around is kind of pointless..."
